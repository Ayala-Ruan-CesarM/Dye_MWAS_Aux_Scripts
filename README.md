# Dye_MWAS_Aux_Scripts
This repository contains all auxiliary scripts used to analyze enviromental metagenomes positive for the textil dye degradation phenotype in a Microbiome wide association study conducted as part of my Master Degree at the National Autonomus University of Mexico at the Lab 14 under SÃ¡nchez-Reyes tutorship.

## How to use Remove_HiC.sh
```
Bash Remove_HiC.sh -i Original_HiC_Sequences.fasta -o Output_HiC_Sequences.fasta

# Currently it removes the chimeric sites GATCGATC AATTAATT GATCAATT
# But those can be change in the script to accomodate needs
```
## How to use Gene_Hits_Annotation_Args.py
```
python Gene_Hits_Annotation_Args.py -i Gene_Hits.txt -b annotation_output.txt -o file_name.txt -k KOs.kegg

# Gene_Hits.txt --> Is a tab file result from annotate_hits.py
# annotation_output.txt --> The annotation output of the hypothetical proteins with diamond/blastp
# KOs.kegg --> KOs IDs and it's annotation
```
## How to use VolcanoPlot.py
```
python VolcanoPlot.py -i associated_kmers.txt -o filename -t 1E-08

# associated_kmers.txt --> Is a tab file result of the association model
# "-o" does not require extension as the jpg is added automatically 
# "-t" or threshold is used to draw the significance line
```
## How to use QQplot.py
```
python QQplot.py -i associated_kmers.txt -o filename
# associated_kmers.txt --> Is a tab file result of the association model
# "-o" does not require extension as the jpg is added automatically 
```
## How to use Script_to_summarize.py
```
python Script_to_summarize.py Gene_Hits.txt
# Gene_Hits.txt --> Is a tab file result from annotate_hits.py
```
## How to use Taxonomic_Scatter_ploy.py
```
python Taxonomic_Scatter_ploy.py -i aldex_result_genus.tsv
# aldex_result_genus.tsv is the output from AlDEX2
```
## How to use VeenDiagram.R
```
# It is design to be used with Rstudio on Windows or similar.
#  

```
## How to use Generar_KernelMatrix_fromBray.R
